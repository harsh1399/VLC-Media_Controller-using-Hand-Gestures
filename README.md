# VLC-Media_Controller-using-Hand-Gestures

The idea of the project is to control VLC media players functionalities such as pause/play, volume increase/decrease using hand gesture detected using object detection mechanisms.
I used MediaPipe (object detection library) hand and finger tracking solution.
